The filing is known as a 606 report after Rule 606 of Regulation NMS National Market System Because so many traders at Reddit s WallStreetBets message board have focused on the fact that billionaire Ken Griffin s Citadel Securities was executing the majority of trades for Robinhood the trading app where a lot of the Redditors directed their GameStop trades we decided to take a look at what other online brokers might have also been directing GameStop trades to Citadel Securities According to the 606 reports for the fourth quarter of 2020 for the following nine online brokers Citadel was providing payment for order flow giving a cash rebate for trade orders directed to it to each of the following Robinhood E Trade TD Ameritrade Charles Schwab WeBull Ally Invest Securities First Trade and TradeStation At Fidelity Brokerage Services it was directing stock and option orders to Citadel Securities but was only receiving payment for order flow on the option orders according to its 606 report According to these 606 reports Citadel ranked as the number one venue for sending both stock and option orders at the following firms Robinhood TD Ameritrade Charles Schwab WeBull Fidelity Brokerage Services and Ally Invest Securities Citadel was the number one venue for options trades by E Trade while ranking lower for stock trades At First Trade and TradeStation Citadel ranked number one for market orders for stocks trades with no stated price limit and number one for options The bottom line here there was a high probability that no matter what online brokerage firm Redditors sent their GameStop orders to initially Ken Griffin s Citadel Securities was getting a piece of the action in the end According to the website of Citadel Securities To maximize trading opportunities for clients our automated trading platform sources liquidity from all U S exchanges and more than 18 alternative liquidity venues That last sentence is what investigators want to look at That is what is the final destination of all of these Citadel Securities trades Alternative liquidity venues may include Dark Pools which are in desperate need of some sunshine See GameStop Shares Dark Pools Owned by

billion Forbes reported Griffin s wealth at just 7 6 billion less than five years ago All that dough sloshing around in Griffin s bank accounts has found some interesting destinations Just ask U S Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen Citadel paid Yellen 992 500 for speaking gigs since she stepped down as Fed Chair in February of 2018 Two of those events on October 17 2019 and December 3 2019 commanded 292 500 each Then at the height of the pandemic in October 2020 Citadel paid Yellen 337 500 in total to speak at unspecified events on October 9 October 20 October 26 and October 27 Yellen s disclosure form also lists a liability to Citadel of 50 001 to 100 000 owed as a refund for a cancelled event Why she hasn t paid that back yet is curious See updated information at end of this article All of this comes from the jaw dropping financial disclosure form that Yellen filed with the try to contain your laughter Office of Government Ethics in advance of her Senate Finance Committee Confirmation Hearing to become the U S Treasury Secretary Yellen s cash haul for speaking gigs in 2019 and 2020 came to more than 7 million with most of that coming from Wall Street firms and hedge

some love by giving my opinion on the matter First of all it is surprising how much of this info is quite accurate so you ve certainly done a good job about that which gives you more credibility IMO Maybe not the hangover part but still Speaking long term this company is here to stay The technology they offer is second to none The ease of operating what we can achieve it really is world changing Robotic surgery is already well established and will continue to grow as more and more procedures are bound to be performed robot assisted and not laparoscopically anymore They have an excellent business model in which instruments are disposable big maintenance contracts and a new model every few years so they did improve actually and continue to do so support for older models is no longer offered at some point so you have to buy the new one They have no competition because they simply buy up any company that is doing anything remotely similar Some other companies I saw are trying to improve laparoscopy rather than completely reinvent it mostly because robotics are quite expensive They try to take the niche for procedures that are too simple to waste robotic resources on but still require a lot of laparoscopic skills However sorry to offend but a lot of these alterations look clunky and seem unreliable and unpractical The only reason why not everyone is using the robot already is exactly this that Intuitive really takes good advantage of its monopoly position and so it really is expensive to use it I believe that at some point in the future another company eventually will offer a robotic system that is up to the same quality standards IMO this can only be a company that is big enough to support their own R D and not be swallowed by Intuitive For me Medtronic is the best bet for this or maybe some Chinese company This then would lead to a significant drop in costs for robotic surgery and probably a big drop in stock price for Intuitive on the other hand it would make robotic surgery even more mainstream and as Intuitive is already quite on top they are likely to be able to withstand the competition and remain a top player in the field and continue to grow from this in the long term It is true that corona caused a backlog even in this kind of surgery it has a lot of oncological applications but even some of those got postponed also put a hold on congresses training programs etc and a tepmorary drop in revenue is certainly possible x200B TLDR I share your opinion that the stock will come down from where it is now but probably only momentarily I will be hoping with you for a drop in Intuitive stock price but will use it as an entry point for a long position instead which in retrospect I should have done already a long time ago In the meantime I am long Medtronic as well Not very wallstreetbetsy but I believe these are both good plays long term","title_sentiment":-0.775,"topcomment_sentiment":0.9956},{"Unnamed:
