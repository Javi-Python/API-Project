Woke up to the news, did some due diligence, but this form of stock sale potential will allow GameStop, if they want, to slowly sell securities to raise money.  They won’t do it all at once, because it’s not in their interest to promote panic, (no panic or price drop is  the purpose of this type of offering, versus a bulk sale, new share issuance, etc)

Minus that minor morning heart attack I’m extremely bullish on the company and the squeeze.  Almost thought it was a major dilution or something dumb af based on the headlines.

Edit:  Here’s the prospectus from the SEC if you want to see, bullet point 2 shows that no sales were made on the last version of this.  https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000119312521105564/d160986d424b5.htm#supprom160986_12

160,1618422010.0,mqvqjb,U.S. Senate votes 53-45 to confirm Gary Gensler as Biden's SEC chief,3657,400,"Since 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission has required brokerage firms to file a quarterly report showing where they are routing their stock trades for execution. The filing is known as a 606 report after Rule 606 of Regulation NMS (National Market System). Because so many traders at Reddit’s WallStreetBets’ message board have focused on the fact that billionaire Ken Griffin’s Citadel Securities was executing the majority of trades for Robinhood, the trading app where a lot of the Redditors directed their GameStop trades, we decided to take a look at what other online brokers might have also been directing GameStop trades to Citadel Securities.

According to the 606 reports for the fourth quarter of 2020 for the following nine online brokers, Citadel was providing payment-for-order-flow (giving a cash rebate for trade orders directed to it) to each of the following: Robinhood, E-Trade, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, WeBull, Ally Invest Securities, First Trade and TradeStation. At Fidelity Brokerage Services, it was directing stock and option orders to Citadel Securities but was only receiving payment-for-order-flow on the option orders, according to its 606 report.

According to these 606 reports, Citadel ranked as the number one venue for sending both stock and option orders at the following firms: Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, WeBull, Fidelity Brokerage Services and Ally Invest Securities. Citadel was the number one venue for options trades by E-Trade while ranking lower for stock trades. At First Trade and TradeStation, Citadel ranked number one for market orders for stocks (trades with no stated price limit) and number one for options.

The bottom line here: there was a high probability that no matter what online brokerage firm Redditors sent their GameStop orders to initially, Ken Griffin’s Citadel Securities was getting a piece of the action in the end. According to the website of Citadel Securities, “To maximize trading opportunities for clients, our automated trading platform sources liquidity from all U.S. exchanges and more than 18 alternative liquidity venues.”

That last sentence is what investigators want to look at. That is, what is the final destination of all of these Citadel Securities trades. “Alternative liquidity venues” may include Dark Pools which are in desperate need of some sunshine. (See GameStop Shares: Dark Pools Owned by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, UBS, et al, Have Made Tens of Thousands of Trades.)

Pay to play in the trading world has worked out very well for Griffin. According to Forbes, as of today, Griffin’s net worth is $15 billion. Forbes reported Griffin’s wealth at just $7.6 billion less than five years ago.

All that dough sloshing around in Griffin’s bank accounts has found some interesting destinations. Just ask U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Citadel paid Yellen $992,500 for speaking gigs since she stepped down as Fed Chair in February of 2018. Two of those events, on October 17, 2019 and December 3, 2019, commanded $292,500 each. Then, at the height of the pandemic in October 2020, Citadel paid Yellen $337,500 in total to speak at unspecified events on October 9; October 20; October 26; and October 27. Yellen’s disclosure form also lists a liability to Citadel of “$50,001 to $100,000,” owed as a refund for a cancelled event. Why she hasn’t paid that back yet is curious. [See updated information at end of this article.]

All of this comes from the jaw-dropping financial disclosure form that Yellen filed with the (try to contain your laughter) Office of Government Ethics in advance of her Senate Finance Committee Confirmation Hearing to become the U.S. Treasury Secretary.

Yellen’s cash haul for speaking gigs in 2019 and 2020 came to more than $7 million, with most of that coming from Wall Street firms and hedge funds. Yellen did not disclose her speaking fees in 2018.

Yellen is now rumored to be hauling together the SEC, the Fed, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission this week to look into the trading in GameStop. In a rational world, Yellen would have to recuse herself from any matter involving Citadel. But when it comes to matters involving Wall Street, we left that rational world in 1999 with the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act which allowed giant federally-insured banks to merge with Wall Street’s casino trading firms for the first time since 1933. It’s been downhill ever since.",SEC,2021-04-14 17:40:10

It's ridiculous how the stock hasn't reacted at all to the great news as of late. Cohen as chairman, plus search for a new CEO. No negative news at all, all the DD still stands. Seen all that stuff before, holding has never been easier.

&#x200B;

People used to draw the VW squeeze comparison, but I disagree. If you want to compare squeezes, compare to TSLA. Long, drawn out, and to ridiculous heights. The institutions in short positions are too stubborn and have too much liquidity to get squeezed out in one short blast. The VW squeeze had an element of surprise, which is missing with GME. But when all the fundamentals keep getting better and better and it gets clear the stock isn't going anywhere back to where it was, shorts will get closed. Slowly, with new shorts being opened on the way, but they will. Also way better scenario for the stock in my opinion. Compare 2008 VW chart to 2020-2021 TSLA chart and pick what you would rather own.",GME,2021-04-13 21:35:12

So My story -

Started in July 2020 with $1.3k( no options) I didn't know what the fuck I was doing

Took a £10k loan in November to buy some internet money-> made about £4/5k and YOLO'ed it all in GME in December/Jan ( sat on 754 shares)

Paper-Handed all 754 shares on ( wait for it) ----> Tuesday eve Jan 26th....( total $108k)

FOMO kicked in the following day-> went back in ..kept buying dips..... paper-handed again in the end and took a $40k loss from previous profits.

Went YOLO again around the time when DFV doubled down.... I keep adding as and when I have a spare $.

**Im not Selling.** **No more Paper Handing.** **~~I Stand Retarded~~**\*\*. I Stand United. I Hold. And I Buy.\*\*

Overall- Currently @$99k profits..

( GME 887 -> average about $110)

ATH profit -> $193k in March 2021

The bullish thesis on AMD is unbelievably strong. AMD is doing 50% revenue growth WITH chip shortages. Margins are growing rapidly and market share as well. AMD is entering new industries and new partnerships rapidly. Lisa SU has conservatively guided another 40% this year but with their usual beats this will be another 50%+ year, if chip shortages resolve could be 60-70%. Tesla AMD partnership has yet to be officially announced. It is likely waiting for the vote on AMD's Xlinix acquisition to be completed before they formally announce it.

AMD currently has P/E of 40 ..... for a company jumping 50% revenue a year. The stock price is heavily weighed down this past 6 months from Xlinix acquisition (which is done through stock sale giving XLNX holders a fixed AMD stock amount). Once Xlinix acquisition is completed and chip shortages are resolved, this rocket ship will take off and likely stock will jump 50% in a matter of months.",AMD,2021-04-05 14:08:51

Sell 300 $28 calls and buy 150 $29 calls. This will turn your long $25 strike calls into $3 long call spreads, while adding $1 short call spreads above it, creating a butterfly spread. This will claw back premium and if by some chance the stock takes off, it's still profitable, with max profit at the $25 strike.

Edit: I wasn't looking at the option chain when I wrote this out, so the strikes available may be different.  This is just an example of how to create a butterfly spread when you already have existing long calls. You can adjust the wings however you want by adjusting the strikes, though you should keep the short wing smaller than the long so you're covered if the price runs.",CLOV,2021-04-30 02:53:43

I read the first paragraph, saw how long the post was and said nah fuck that. I'm glad DD is being put out on the company though.


I'd like to contribute by voicing my experience having UWMC underwrite my loan. I live in an area where selling your house at the listed price means you fucked up. Since buying my house in july its 'value' (according to redfin, take it with a grain of salt) has gone up 30K in value. To say it's a sellers market is an understatement.


All that being said, I contacted 5 companies about securing my home loan. Of the 5, UWMC was the fastest in replying, had the most competitive rates, and had the best customer service I experienced. 


What do I mean by faster replying? I heard back from Todd later that same day about my loan. Once my side of paperwork was submitted, it took... 2 days? Max? To get a pre-qualification that allowed me to make an offer. To put in perspective, I didnt hear back from the slowest until i closed (offer submitted Friday, reviewed monday, called tuesday saying it was mine if I wanted it).


What do I mean by beat rates? Better than the worst by over a whole percent.


What do I mean by best customer service? I emailed todd late saturday about some random question I had, fully expecting a response no earlier than Monday. This motherfucker hits me up with a response at 11pm that night.


Having said all this, I currently own no UWMC and do not plan on buying any just yet. Im full ape and 100% in GME. That being said, UWMC Is REAL fucking high on my GME tendie reinvestment plan.

I'm in with 2k shares on CLOV, so don't take this the wrong way.    


Two points. 

1)  When you just dismiss something out of hand, it does take away from your otherwise great writing.    


""As you can see it says deceleration on the top left. This is ok because the stock is so young id just ignore that since we've clearly bottomed out now.""  


If it's so clear, why doesn't the marker, whatever it is, show that?  If you dismiss something out of hand, it appears you're trying to hide something.  Most people, especially those who have been manipulated for years in the market, can see that.  


2) Your closing.  ""We just need volume"" requires a whole lot of other things in order to happen.  A news release, continued buying by lots of retail and no selling from institutions, something outside of our control.  Government mandate that everyone use CLOV.   So, yeah, volume isn't a simple thing to solve.  


Other than that, the play was great.",CLOV,2021-04-28 03:19:07

In Germany we have „ADAC“ which analyzes all accident data’s of all cars in Europe and Tesla is on the top of all accidents.
In general electric cars are having 20% more accidents just because they are silent and people actually look on their smartphones than on the street - so not always the drivers or cars fault. But Tesla has a 50% higher accident quote than all other companies in Europe. Unfortunately I only have a German Link.

Lisa Su tends to be conservative in her guidance, so you may want to sell before earnings, or hedge your bets here.  However, I believe she'll guide much higher, considering all the rumors of extra Wafer capacity at TSMC, to as high as 80% extra capacity at 7nm, due to Apple jumping to 5nm early \[[https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-overtakes-Apple-as-TSMC-s-main-7nm-customer.528532.0.html](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-overtakes-Apple-as-TSMC-s-main-7nm-customer.528532.0.html)\]; so if you're a betting person, you'll hold onto your calls, especially if they're already ITM, because I'm expecting AMD to go stratospheric!

Today we answer that question and dividing by 0 ($ISRG)",189,115,"Thank you for sharing. As a robot surgeon myself, maybe I can give back some love by giving my opinion on the matter.

First of all, it is surprising how much of this info is quite accurate so you 've certainly done a good job about that, which gives you more credibility IMO. Maybe not the hangover part but still.

Speaking long term, this company is here to stay. The technology they offer is second to none.  The ease of operating, what we can achieve, it really is world changing. Robotic surgery is already well established and will continue to grow as more and more procedures are bound to be performed robot-assisted and not laparoscopically anymore.

They have an excellent business model in which instruments are disposable, big maintenance contracts, and a new model every few years (so they did improve, actually, and continue to do so); support for older models is no longer offered at some point so you have to buy the new one.

They have no competition because they simply buy up any company that is doing anything remotely similar. Some other companies I saw are trying to improve laparoscopy rather than completely reinvent  it, mostly because robotics are quite expensive. They try to take the niche for procedures that are too simple to waste robotic resources on, but still require a lot of laparoscopic skills. However, sorry to offend, but a lot of these alterations look clunky and seem unreliable and unpractical.

The only reason why not everyone is using the robot already, is exactly this, that Intuitive really takes good advantage of its monopoly position, and so it really is expensive to use it.

I believe that at some point in the future, another company eventually will offer a robotic system that is up to the same quality standards. IMO this can only be a company that is big enough to support their own R&D and not be swallowed by Intuitive. For me, Medtronic is the best bet for this (or maybe some Chinese company). This then would lead to a significant drop in costs for robotic surgery (and probably a big drop in stock price for Intuitive); on the other hand, it would make robotic surgery even more mainstream and as Intuitive is already quite on top, they are likely to be able to withstand the competition and remain a top player in the field, and continue to grow from this in the long term.

It is true that corona caused a backlog even in this kind of surgery (it has a lot of oncological applications, but even some of those got postponed), also put a hold on congresses, training programs etc. and a tepmorary drop in revenue is certainly possible.

&#x200B;

TLDR: I share your opinion that the stock will come down from where it is now, but probably only momentarily. I will be hoping with you for a drop in Intuitive stock price, but will use it as an entry point for a long position instead (which in retrospect, I should have done already a long time ago). In the meantime, I am long Medtronic as well. Not very wallstreetbetsy, but I believe these are both good plays long term.",ISRG,2021-04-16 15:03:40

You either took profits too early, too late, got in too early, too late, didn’t put enough in at the beginning, etc. There is no perfect trade, and if you look at the charts later you’ll always wish you did something different even if you made money. Don’t look back when you take profits, and treat a loss as a learning experience. Setting trailing stops going in can keep your game plan focused and prevent you from getting greedy. And if the money you have in it stressed you out, you’re probably over committed. Try trading with a third of the money you have in your account right now and see how that changes your stress level. Remember the more stressed you are the less you’ll be able to make logical decisions, and that’s when you’ll start making the wrong call and getting needlessly risky.",,2021-04-20 08:40:20
